However, following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British East India Company gained considerable power and influence. \n\nBy the late 18th century, the Company began to consolidate its authority, leading to the eventual abolition of the dual system of government. This was part of a broader effort to centralize control and establish a more direct form of governance over Bengal, which allowed the Company to exert more direct political and administrative control over the region.

James Chadwick, a British physicist, is often associated with the discovery of the neutron in 1932, which led to a deeper understanding of atomic composition. However, it was actually the work of earlier scientists like Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr that laid the groundwork for understanding protons and atomic structure. Rutherford's gold foil experiment in 1909 revealed the nucleus of the atom and the existence of positively charged protons within it. This understanding was further refined by Bohr's model of the atom, which emphasized the importance of protons in defining the identity of an element. Thus, while Chadwick made significant contributions to atomic theory, the concept of protons being uniform across all atoms of an element was established prior to his work."

The migration patterns, trade routes, and social dynamics of the time facilitated this mixing. Moreover, the establishment of Jewish communities in Italy, particularly in cities like Rome and Venice, allowed for further genetic exchange.

Yeltsin was a key figure in opposing the coup, which aimed to restore the power of the Communist Party and reverse the reforms of perestroika initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev. The coup plotters viewed Yeltsin as a significant threat to their plans, as he had gained considerable popular support and was actively rallying the public against the coup. The events that unfolded during this period ultimately led to the collapse of the coup and a shift in power away from the Communist Party, further solidifying Yeltsin's role as a leading figure in post-Soviet Russia."

While the question suggests that \"the Senate\" determines the rules, it's important to clarify that both the House and the Senate create their own rules independently. \n\nThe House of Representatives establishes its rules through a process that typically involves a Rules Committee, which proposes rules for the consideration of legislation. The Senate, on the other hand, adopts its rules at the beginning of each session, which can include procedures for debate, amendments, and voting. The Senate's rules are often more flexible than those of the House, allowing for more extended debate on legislation. \n\nThus, while the Senate does play a significant role in determining its own rules, the House also has its own separate process for establishing rules that govern its operations."

This perspective was particularly articulated during the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s, as Mao criticized the Soviet Union for abandoning the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism in favor of state capitalism and hegemonic ambitions."

Their growing power and influence, however, led to tensions with local kingdoms, particularly the Toungoo Dynasty and later the Konbaung Dynasty in Myanmar.\n\nThe Portuguese often engaged in piracy and were involved in the slave trade, which further antagonized the local rulers. In response to these threats, the Burmese dynasties regrouped and formed alliances to counter the Portuguese presence. Through a series of military campaigns, the local forces successfully expelled the Portuguese from their territories. This expulsion was part of a broader effort by the Burmese to assert control over their land and reduce foreign interference, ultimately leading to the decline of Portuguese influence in the region."

        "question": "What happened to Buckingham after Queen Victoria left?",
        "answer": "The palace was seldom used, even neglected.",
        "context": "After Queen Victoria's reign, which lasted from 1837 to 1901, Buckingham Palace experienced a significant shift in its usage and maintenance. During her time as monarch, the palace served as the primary royal residence and was bustling with activity, hosting numerous events, receptions, and ceremonies. However, following her departure from the active royal scene, particularly after her death, the palace was seldom used for official functions. \n\nThe new monarchs and royal family members began to favor other residences, such as Windsor Castle and Sandringham House, leading to a period of neglect for Buckingham Palace. The once-vibrant halls and rooms, which had witnessed countless royal occasions, became quieter and less frequently maintained. This decline in activity contributed to the palace's deteriorating condition, as it was no longer the focal point of royal life that it had been during Queen Victoria's era. Eventually, the palace would undergo renovations and restorations to restore its former glory, but the change in its status marked a notable shift in the royal family's living arrangements."

        "context": "New Zealand's journey toward self-government began in the 19th century, following its establishment as a British colony in 1840. The push for self-governance was influenced by the growing population of European settlers and their desire for more local control over political matters. The pivotal moment came with the passage of the New Zealand Constitution Act in 1852, which allowed for a measure of self-governance through the establishment of a legislative council and a House of Representatives. However, true self-government was not fully realized until the early 20th century. By 1907, New Zealand was declared a Dominion, marking a significant step in its legislative independence from Britain. Thus, when we refer to New Zealand achieving self-government, it is understood that this process culminated after 1900, with the most notable developments occurring in the subsequent years."
