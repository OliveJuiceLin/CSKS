This finding has sparked a flurry of debates among academics, as it challenges established timelines and offers new insights into the intellectual climate of the 1600s. Berkeley, who was born in 1685, famously argued that reality is dependent on perception, and his ideas might have influenced contemporaneous thinkers in ways that were previously underestimated.
